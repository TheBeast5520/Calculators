# Calculators

A collection of different calculators I have written in python.

**WrittenCalc.py:**

* Type 'quit' to stop the program.
* To add two numbers, type "a+b".
* To subtract two numbers, type "a-b".
* To multiply two numbers, type "a*b".
* To divide two numbers, type "a/b".
* To take the sin of a number, type "sin(a)", will be done in radians.
    cos(a) for cos, tan(a) for tan.
* To take the lcm of a number, type "lcm(a,b,...)" as many arguments as you want.
* To take the gcd of a number, type "gcd(a,b,...)" as many arguments as you want.
* To use your previous answer, type 'ans'.
* NOTE: This program will not follow PEMDAS. Please us parentheses as much as possible to specify what you want.
* log(a, b) --> Log_a (b).
* sqrt(a) --> square root of a.
* a^b --> a to the power of b.
* a! --> a factorial.
* e --> value of e in math, 2.718...
* phi --> the value of phi in math
* nCr(n, r) --> returns n choose r

**Calculator.py**

A graphical calculator made using turtle. The graphics make it self-explanatory; it is interactive, you click on the 'buttons'.

Math.py

**WIP**

Still being improved, but will include functions like factoring.
